assists officers in maintaining proper control of their vehicles in pursuit and/or 
emergency high-speed operations.

to -ensure the safety of all personnel and their families. In accordance with

transported in a Department vehicle is required to be secured by a safety belt 
where provided by the vehicle manufacturer. Officers are.exempt from this 
policy when: 
L The rear seat belts have. been removed. 
2 The prisoner is resisting or combative and the officer's safety 
would be jeopardized by attempting to secure a safety belt around the 
prisoner. If available, a wagon should be used to tansport such prisoners, 
3. The prisoner's size or build, coupled with vehicle configuration, create a 
hardship to accomplish. the securing of the safety belt around the prisoner. 
F. REMOVAL OF SEAT BELTS. When arriving at an emergency call, a 
potentially dangerous situation or making a vehicle traffic stop, officers xky 
remove the safety restraint for a quick exit just prior to stopping. In traffic 
stops, the officer must be reasonably sure that the violator is going to stop

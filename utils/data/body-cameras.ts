Body Worn Camera s 
 
10.11.01 PURPOSE  
The use of Body Worn Cameras (BWC) is an effective tool a law enforcement agency can 
use to demonstrate its commitment to transparency, ensure the accountability of its members, 
increase the public’s trust in officers, and protect its members from unjustified complaints of 
misconduct. As such, the San Francisco Police Department is committed to establishing a 
BWC program that reinforces its responsibility for protecting public and officer safe ty. The 
purpose of this Department General Order is to establish the policies and procedures 
governing the Department’s BWC program and to ensure members’ effective and rigorous 
use of BWC and adherence to the program.  
The BWC is a small audio -video recorder with the singular purpose of recording audio/visual 
files, specifically designed to be mounted on a person. The BWC is designed to record audio 
and video activity to preserve evidence for use in criminal and administrative investigations 
(including disc iplinary cases), civil litigation, officer performance evaluations, and to review 
police procedures and tactics, as appropriate.  While recordings obtained from a BWC 
provide an objective record of the recorded events, it is understood that video recordings  
captured by a BWC (or any other recording device) provide a limited perspective and do not 
necessarily reflect the experience or state of mind of the individual member wearing the 
BWC in a given incident. 
 
10.11.02 POLICY  
 
A. Use of Equipment -  The Department -issued BWC is authorized for use in the course

issued BWCs. The BWC and all recorded data from the BWC are the property of the 
Department. The use of non- Department issued BWCs while on- duty is prohibited. 
 
B. Training -  Prior to the issuance of BWCs, officers will be trained on the operation and 
care of the BWCs. This training w ill include mandatory, permissible and prohibited 
uses, significant legal developments, and use of BWCs in medical facilities. 
 
C. Program Administrator -  The Risk Management Office (RMO) is the BWC’s 
program administrator. The duties of the RMO include, but are not limited to:

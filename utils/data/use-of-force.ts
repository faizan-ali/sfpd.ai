  USE OF FORCE POLICY AND PROPER CONTROL OF A PERSON  
 
The San Francisco Police Department’s highest priority is safeguarding the life, dignity and 
liberty of all persons. Officers shall demonstrate this principle in their daily interactions with the community they are sworn to protect and serve. The Department is committed to accomplishing this mission with respect and minimal reliance on the us e of force by using rapport -building 
communication, crisis intervention, and de -escalation tactics before resorting to force, whenever 
feasible. This Department General Order (DGO) builds upon the Supreme Court’s broad 
principles in Graham v. Connor (1989)  490 U.S. 386 and is more restrictive than the 
constitutional standard and state law. The Law Enforcement Code of Ethics requires all sworn law enforcement officers to carry out their duties with courtesy, respect, professionalism, and to never employ unne cessary force. These are key factors in maintaining legitimacy with the 
community and safeguarding the public’s trust.  
5.01.01  PURPOSE  
 
This order establishes policies and reporting procedures regarding the use of force. The purpose of the policy is to guide an officer’s decisions regarding the use and application of force to ensure such applications are used only to effect arrest or lawful detentions or to bring a situation under legitimate control and assist the Department in achieving its highest priority. No policy can anticipate every conceivable situation or exceptional circumstance which officers may face. In all circumstances, officers are expected to exercise sound judgment and critical decision making when using force options. It is the policy of the Department to review rigorously every instance in which a firearm is discharged, including exceptional circumstances, on a case -by-case 
basis to evaluate all facts to determine if the discharge is within policy pursuant to D GO 3.10 
Firearm Discharge Review  Board. 
 
5.01.02  POLICY  
 
A. SAFEGUARDING HUMAN LIFE AND DIGNITY -  The authority to use force is a 
serious responsibility given to peace officers by the people who expect them to exercise that authority judiciously and with respect for human rights, dignity and life. 
B. ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION - Communication with non- compliant subjects is often 
most effective when officers establish rapport, use the proper voice intonation, ask questions and provide advice to defuse conflict and achieve voluntary compliance before resort ing to force  options. 
C. DE-ESCALATION - Officers shall, when feasible, employ de -escalation 
strategies and 
techniques to mitigate the need to use a higher level of force and to increase the likelihood of a 
peaceful resolution. Officers shall, when feasible, attempt to build rapport and consider the Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23

 possible reasons why a subject may be noncompliant. This information may not make the 
subject any less dangerous. However, understanding a subject’s mental or physical state may enable 
officers to influence the subject’s behavior thereby allowing officers to use de -escalation strategies 
and techniques while maintaining public and officer safety. Officers who act to de -escalate an 
incident, which can delay taking a subject into custody, while keeping the public and officers safe, 
will not be found to have neglected their duty. They will be found to have fulfilled it.  
D. PROPORTIONALITY -  When determining the appropriate level of force, officers shall, 
when feasible, balance the severity of the offense committed and the level of resistance, 
based on the totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time, with the level of force used and its likely injury outcome. It is particularly important that 
officers apply proportionality and critical decision making when encountering an armed 
subject.  
E. CRISIS INTERVENTION - When feasible, Crisis Intervention Team  (CIT) -certified 
officers shall respond to calls for service involving individuals in mental or behavioral health crisis pursuant to DGO 5.21, The Crisis Intervention Team Response to Person in Crisis Calls for Service.  
F. DUTY TO INTERCEDE -  When an officer recognizes that another officer is engaging in 
excessive use of force and has opportunity to prevent it, the officer has  a duty to intervene 
and prevent the harm from occurring. Members shall immediately report potential excessive force to a superior officer when present and observing another member using force that the member believes to be beyond that which is necessary, a s determined by an 
objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances based upon the totality of information actually known to the officer. (See Section 7286 of the Government  Code)  
G. FAIR AND UNBIASED POLICING -  Members shall carry out their duties, including the 
use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased pursuant to DGO 5.17, Bias -Free 
Policing Policy.  
H. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS -  The use of force against vulnerable populations – 
including children, elderly persons, pregnant women, people with physical and mental disabilities and people with limited English proficiency – can undermine public trust and should be used as a last resort, when all other reasonable means have been  exhausted.  
 
5.01.03  DEFINITIONS  
 
A. FEASIBLE -  Reasonably capable of being done or carried out under the circumstances to 
successfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another person. Cal. Government Code § Section 7286(a)(2).  
 
B. MINIMAL AMOUNT OF FORCE NECESSARY -  The lowest level of force within the 
range of objectively reasonable force that is necessary to effect an arrest or achieve a lawful 
objective without increasing the risk to others.
C. PERSONAL BODY WEAPONS -  An officer’s use of their body part, including but not Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 3 of 25  
 limited to hand, foot, knee, elbow, shoulder, hip, arm, leg, or head by means of high 
velocity kinetic energy transfer (impact) to gain control of a  subject.  
D. REASONABLE FORCE -  Force that would be objectively reasonable “from the 
perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.” Cal. Penal Code § 835a(a)(4).  
E. REPORTABLE FORCE -  All uses of force are reportable except for Type I force. Types II, 
III, and IV force are reportable. The types of force are defined in subsection 5.01.07, Types of Force. 
F. SERIOUS BODILY INJURY -  A serious impairment of physical condition, including but 
not limited to loss of consciousness, concussion, bone fracture, protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ, a wound requiring extensive suturing, and serious  disfigurement. 
G. VITAL AREAS OF THE BODY -  The head, neck, face, throat, spine, groin and kidney.  
H. DEADLY FORCE -  Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or 
serious bodily injury, including but not limited to the discharge of a firearm. Cal. Penal Code § 835a(e)(1).  
I. IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY - A threat of death 
or serious bodily injury is “imminent” when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the 
peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the har m, but is one 
that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed. Cal. Penal Code § 835a(e)(2).  
J. INTERCEDE – Includes, but is not limited to, physically stopping the excessive use of 
force, recording the excessive force, if equipped with a body- worn camera, and 
documenting efforts to intervene, the efforts to deescalate the offending officer’s excessi ve 
use of force, and confronting the offending officer about the excessive force during the use of force and, if the officer continues, reporting to dispatch or the watch commander on duty and stating the offending officer’s name, unit, location, time, and situation, in order to establish a duty for that officer to intervene. (See Section 7286 of the Government  Code.)  
 
K. DE-ESCALATION - The process of using strategies and techniques intended to decrease 
the intensity of the  situation.
L. STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS -  The use of verbal and non- verbal  techniques to aid 
in the controlling of a situation and enhancing officer and community safety.  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 4 of 25  
 M. RAPPORT -  The use of verbal and non -verbal communication to develop insight and 
understanding of a subject and to achieve more effective  dialogue.  
 
5.01.04  CONSIDERATIONS GOVERNING ALL USES OF  FORCE 
 
A. USE OF FORCE MUST BE FOR A LAWFUL PURPOSE -  Officers may use objectively 
reasonable force options in the performance of their duties, in the following circumstances:  
1. To effect a lawful arrest, detention, or  search.  
2. To overcome resistance or to prevent  escape.  
3. To prevent the commission of a public  offense.  
4. In defense of others or in  self-defense.  
5. To gain compliance with a lawful  order.  
6. To prevent a person from injuring themself. However, an officer is prohibited from 
using lethal force against a person who presents only a danger to themself and does not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to another person or officer . 
 
B. USE OF FORCE EVALUATION - The United States Supreme Court in Graham v. 
Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386 held that an officer’s use of force must be objectively reasonable under the totality of circumstances known to the officer at the time. This General Order builds upon the broad principles in Graham by adding additional factors 
upon which an officer’s use of force shall be evaluated. This General Order  is more 
restrictive than the constitutional standard and state law. Officers must strive to use the minimal amount of force  necessary.  
1. The objective reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than 20/20 hindsight, and 
without regard to the officer’s underlying intent or  motivation.  
2. Factors for evaluating the use of force include but are not limited  to: 
a. Nature of the threat posed (see also DGO 5.01.02.D, “ Proportionality ,” and 
5.01.03.I, “ Imminent  Threat ”) 
b. The severity of the crime at  issue;  
c. The level of resistance of the subject;  
d. The effort by the subject to evade arrest by flight; 
e. The time available to the officer to make decisions during  circumstances that are 
tense, uncertain, and rapidly- evolving;
f. The availability of other feasible, less intrusive force  options;  
g. The officer’s tactical conduct and decisions preceding the use of  force;  
h. Whether the officer has reason to believe that the subject is mentally ill, has a physical, developmental or cognitive disability, is emotionally disturbed or is Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 5 of 25  
 under the influence of alcohol or  drugs;  
i. Whether there was an opportunity to warn about the use of force prior  to force 
being used, and if so, was such a warning given;  
j. Whether there was any assessment by the officer of the subject’s ability to cease 
resistance and/or comply with the officer’s  commands;  
k. Specialized knowledge, skills, or abilities of  subjects;  
l. Prior contact;  
m. Environmental factors, including but not limited to lighting, footing, sound conditions, crowds, traffic and other hazards;  and 
n. Whether the subject’s escape could pose a future safety  risk. 
Not all of the above factors may be present or relevant in a particular situation, 
and there may be additional factors not listed.  
 
C. DE-ESCALATION - Barring exigent circumstances, the primary objective of the first 
responding officer(s) should be to observe the incident from a distance, assess the nature of 
the call, and gather the appropriate personnel or resources. When encountering a non-compliant o r armed subject, officers shall, when feasible, use de - escalation strategies and 
techniques in an effort to reduce the need or level of force, including:  
1. Make reasonable attempts to isolate and contain the  subject;  
2. Create time and distance from the subject by establishing a buffer zone (reactionary gap) and utilize cover to avoid creating an imminent threat that may require the use of  force;  
3. Request additional resources, such as Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)  certified 
officers, Hostage/Crisis Negotiation Team, or an Extended Range Impact Weapon;  
4. In order to minimize overwhelming or conflicting communication, one  officer 
should be responsible at any given time for reasonable attempts to establish rapport and engage in strategic communication with the  subject;  
5. Tactically re -position as often as necessary to maintain the reactionary gap, 
protect the public, and preserve officer safety;  and 
6. Continue de -escalation strategies and techniques and take as much time as 
reasonably necessary to resolve the incident, without having to use force, if feasible.
 
Other options, not listed above, may be available to assist in de -escalation efforts.  
Supervisors who become aware of a situation where an officer is using de-
escalation techniques shall monitor the radio communications and evaluate the need to respond to the  scene.  
 Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 6 of 25  
 D. CRITICAL DECISION -MAKING MODEL -  Using a critical decision -making model, 
officers shall collect information, assess the threats and risk, consider police powers and the 
Department’s policies, identify options and determine the best  course of action, and review 
and re -assess the situation.  
E. UNLAWFUL PURPOSES -  Penal Code Section 149 provides criminal penalties for every 
public officer who “under color of authority, without lawful necessity, assaults or beats any 
person.” An assault and battery committed by officers constitute gross and unlawf ul 
misconduct and will be criminally  investigated. 
F. SUBJECT ARMED WITH A WEAPON - NOTIFICATION AND COMMAND -  In 
situations where a subject is armed with a weapon, officers and supervisors shall comply 
with the  following:  
1. OFFICER’S RESPONSIBILITY -  Upon being dispatched to or on- viewing a subject 
with a weapon, an officer shall call a supervisor as soon as  feasible.  
2. SUPERVISORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES -  When notified that officers are dispatched 
to or on- view a subject armed with a weapon, a supervisor  shall respond and, as soon 
as feasible:  
a. Notify DEM, monitor radio communications, respond to the incident (e.g., 
“3X100, I’m monitoring the incident and responding.”);  
b. Notify officers, absent a “Code 33” or other articulable reasons why it would be unsafe to do so, to use time, distance and/or other de -escalation tactics (as 
defined in Section 5.01.04 C.1- 6), if  appropriate;  
c. Upon arrival, where appropriate, the supervisor shall assume  command, and 
ensure appropriate resources are on -scene or are responding. 
 
5.01.05  LEVELS OF  RESISTANCE  
 
A. COMPLIANT - Subject offers no resistance.  
B. PASSIVE NON -COMPLIANCE -  Does not respond to verbal commands but also 
offers no physical form of  resistance.  
C. ACTIVE RESISTANCE -  Physically evasive movements to defeat an officer’s 
attempt at control including bracing, tensing, running away, verbally or physically signaling an intention to avoid or prevent being taken into or retained in  custody. 
D. ASSAULTIVE -  Aggressive or combative; attempting to assault the officer or another 
person, verbally or physically displays an intention to assault the officer  or another  person.Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 7 of 25  
 E. LIFE -THREATENING -  Any action likely to result in serious bodily injury or  death of 
the officer or another  person. 
The following chart illustrates how a subject’s level of resistance (as a lone consideration) 
may factor into the selection of reasonable force options.

Officers shall strive to use the minimum amount of force necessary to accomplish their lawful 
purpose.  
 
A. LOW LEVEL FORCE – Force that creates a minimal risk of injury, including but not 
limited to, verbal commands, uniformed presence, and control  holds.  
B. INTERMEDIATE FORCE - Force that creates a significant risk of injury, including but 
not limited to, personal body weapons, tackling, Oleoresin Capsicum ( OC) spray, and 
impact  weapons.  
C. DEADLY FORCE - Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or 
serious bodily injury, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm. Cal. Penal 
Code § 835a(e)(1).  
 
5.01.07  TYPES OF  FORCE 
 
For the purposes of reporting, investigating, evaluating, and reviewing, uses of force are 
identified as one of four types: Type I, II, III and IV. 
Type & Definition  Applicable 
Tools/Techniques  Examples  
TYPE I  
[Non -Reportable]:  
 
Type I force occurs when an officer’s physical interaction 
with a subject (1) is reasonably 
unlikely to cause pain or injury; or (2) does not cause 
pain or injury; or (3) the 
subject does not report pain or 
injury.  The use of hands or 
equipment to stop, move, direct, or otherwise exercise control of a person or situation.  
Non-injurious physical 
control holds to gain compliance that are not reasonably likely to cause pain. 
Placement of tire deflation 
device (e.g., Spike Strips) where there is no contact with or deflation of vehicle tires.  
 
Circumstances of drawing and exhibiting a firearm. (NOTE: Drawing and Exhibiting a firearm requires 
documentation and Officers hold the wrist of a subject in crisis in place while paramedics secure the subject in a 4 -point 
restraint.  
Officers nudge past people, in order to wedge through a crowd.  
Two officers separate two agitated, arguing subjects, grabbing each subject above the elbow and guiding him away from the other combatant.  
 
During handcuffing, a 
suspect turns his torso as the 
officer makes physical 
contact. The officer grips 
the wrists of the subject 
firmly to prevent further 
movement by the subject.  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23

firearm at a suspect, 
covering their lower body, 
in response to an 
imminent deadly threat.  
TYPE III:  
 
Force that creates a 
significant risk of physical injury, other than Type IV force.  
 
Any force resulting in serious 
bodily injury or death is 
classified as Type IV.  Arrest or Control techniques that result in or are likely to cause injury greater than transitory pain. 
Use of intermediate force 
options upon a person, including but not limited to personal body weapons, chemical agents, and impact weapons.  
Use of an Extended Range Impact Weapon or other impact projectile at a person.  
Placement of tire deflation device (e.g., Spike Strips) with confirmed contact, and deflation of tires resulting in less than a Type IV injury.

5.01.08  FORCE  OPTIONS 
 
The force options authorized by the Department are physical controls, personal body weapons, chemical agents, impact weapons, extended range impact weapons, vehicle interventions, K -9 
bites, and firearms. These are the force options available to officers, but officers are not required to use these force options bas ed on a continuum. While deploying a particular force option and, 
when feasible, officers shall continually evaluate whether the force option may be discontinued while still achieving the arrest or lawful objective.  
A. TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR FORCE OPTIONS -  The following tools and 
techniques are not in a particular order nor are they all  inclusive. 
 Verbal Commands/Instructions/Command Presence 
 Control  Holds/Takedowns  
 Personal Body Weapons  
 Chemical Agents (Pepper Spray, OC, etc.) 
 Impact Weapon (Wood baton, collapsible baton, Yawara, etc) 
 Impact Projectile (such as  ERIW)  
 K-9 Bite  
 Vehicle Intervention (Deflection)  
 Firearms  
B. PHYSICAL CONTROLS/PERSONAL BODY WEAPONS -  Physical controls, such as 
control holds, takedowns, strikes with personal body weapons, and other weaponless techniques are designed to gain compliance of, and/or control over, uncooperative or resistant  subjects.  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 11 of 25  
 1. PURPOSE -  When a subject offers some degree of passive or active  resistance to a 
lawful order, in addition to de -escalation techniques and appropriate 
communication skills, officers may use physical controls consistent  with 
Department training to gain compliance. A subject’s level of resistance and the threat 
posed by the subject are important factors in determining what type of physical controls or personal body weapons should be used.
 
2. USE -  Officers shall consider the relative size and possible physical capabilities of 
the subject compared to the size, physical capabilities, skills, and experience of the 
officer. When faced with a situation that may necessitate the use of physical 
contr ols, officers shall consider requesting additional resources to the scene prior to 
making contact with the subject, if feasible. Different physical controls involve 
different levels of force and risk of injury to a subject or to an officer. Some 
physical c ontrols may actually involve a greater risk of injury or pain to a subject 
than other force  options.  
3. PROHIBITED USE OF CAROTID RESTRAINT, CHOKE HOLDS, OR 
POSTIONAL ASPHYXIA -  Officers are prohibited by Government  Code 7286.5 
from using the following control  holds:  
a. Carotid restraint -  A vascular neck restraint or any similar restraint, hold, or 
other defensive tactic in which pressure is applied to the sides of a person’s 
neck that involves a substantial risk of restricting blood flow  and may render the 
person unconscious in order to subdue or control the person.  
b. Choke hold -  Any defensive tactic or force option in which direct  pressure is 
applied to a person’s trachea or  windpipe.  
c. Positional asphyxia – Situating a person in a manner that compresses  their 
airway and reduces the ability to sustain adequate breathing. This includes, 
without limitation, the use of any physical restraint that causes a person’s 
respiratory airway to be compressed or impairs the person’s breathing or 
respiratory, including any action in which pressure or body weight is 
unreasonably applied against a restrained person’s neck, torso, or back, or 
positioning a restrained person without reasonable monitoring for signs of  
asphyxia. 
4. PROHIBITED USE OF PHYSICAL CONTROL TO HEAD, NECK AND 
THROAT - Officers may not apply pressure while using any use of force tool, 
physical control or personal weapons, and other weaponless techniques such as knee, 
other body part to the head, neck or throat of a person while effecting an arrest of a person, overcoming resistance, or preventing escape unless an exigent circumstance  
arises.  
Exigent Circumstance Exception -  An exigent circumstance arises when an officer 
reasonably believes, based on specific and articulable facts, that a threat exists to a 
person’s safety, the safety of others, or the safety of the involved officer(s). When an Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 12 of 25  
 officer applies force, pressure or control to the head, neck or throat of a subject, the 
officer shall, as soon as safe and feasible, take the following actions:  
a. Continually reassess whether the circumstances leading to the exigent use of the force option or technique still  apply;  
 
 
b. Avoid contact with, or putting pressure on, the person’s trachea or airway in any way;  
c. Discontinue the force option or technique and/or transition to a  different force 
option as soon feasible;  
d. Monitor the subject for breathing and responsiveness and ensure the subject is 
medically  assessed;  
e. Notify a  supervisor;  
f. Document and articulate the circumstances and steps taken in the corresponding 
incident  report.  
 
5. SAFEGUARDING DIGNITY – While conducting an arrest or detention in the field, 
officers shall not direct a subject to involuntarily sit, lay, kneel or otherwise assume a lowered position on the ground, unless there are specific and articulable safety concern s. 
When the officer determines that the safety concern is sufficiently addressed, the officer shall immediately get the person off the ground with dignity and respect.  
The corresponding arrest or detention report shall document and articulate the specific safety concerns, within the totality of circumstances, that led the officer to involuntarily direct the subject to the ground, as well as related follow -up at the 
scene. Specific factors may include the nature or type of call, pre -assaultive behavior, 
evasive efforts or indicators, access to weapons, number and/or size of subjects, mental status or apparent intoxication of the subject, and/or other considerations. 
Generalized or rote factors may not sufficiently address this subsection on their own.  
6. MEDICAL ASSESSMENT -  Any subject who has been injured, complains of an injury 
in the presence of officers, or complains of pain that persists beyond the use of the physical control hold shall be medically assessed by emergency medical  personnel.  
C. CHEMICAL AGENTS -  Chemical agents, such as OC  Spray, are designed to cause 
irritation and temporarily incapacitate a  subject.  
1. PURPOSE -  Chemical agents can be used to subdue an unarmed attacker or to 
overcome active resistance (unarmed or armed with a weapon other than a firearm) that is likely to result in injury to either the subject or the officer. In many instances, 
chemical agents can reduce or eliminate the necessity to use other force options to 
gain compliance, consistent with Department  training. Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 13 of 25  
 2. WARNING - Officers shall provide a warning prior to deploying a  chemical agent, if  
feasible:  
a. Announce a warning to the subject and other officers of the intent to deploy the 
chemical agent if the subject does not comply with officer commands;  and  
 
b. Give the subject a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply, unless it would pose a risk to the public or the officer or permit the subject to undermine the deployment of the chemical  agent.  
3. MANDATORY FIRST AID -  At the scene or as soon as possible, officers  shall 
administer first aid  by: 
a. Seating the subject or other person(s) exposed to a chemical agent in an upright 
position, and  
b. Flushing their eyes out with clean water and ventilate with fresh air. 
4. MANDATORY MEDICAL ASSESSMENT -  Any person exposed to a chemical 
agent shall be medically assessed by emergency medical personnel. Any exposed 
person shall be kept under direct visual observation until medically assessed. If an exposed person loses consciousness or has difficulty breathing, an officer shall immediately request for emergency medical personnel, render first aid and monitor the subject until relieved by emergency medical personnel. Officers shall notify dispatch to expedite emergency medical personnel if the person loses consciousness 
or has difficulty breathing. 
5. TRANSPORTATION -  Subjects in custody exposed to a chemical agent must be 
transported in an upright position by two officers. The passenger officer shall closely monitor the subject for any signs of distress. If the subject loses consciousness or has diffic ulty breathing, officers shall immediately seek emergency medical attention. 
Hobble cords or similar types of restraints shall only be used to secure a subject’s legs 
together. They shall not be used to connect the subject’s legs to their waist or hands or to a fixed  object. 
6. BOOKING FORM - Officers shall note on the booking form that the subject has been 
exposed to a chemical  agent.  
D. IMPACT WEAPON -  Department issued and authorized impact weapons include the 26” 
straight wooden baton, the 36” straight wooden baton, the wooden or polymer Yawara stick, the 21” to 29” telescopic metal baton and the wooden bokken and are designed to temporarily incapacita te a subject.  
1. PURPOSE -  An impact weapon may be used in accordance with Department training 
to administer strikes to non -vital areas of the body, which can subdue an assaultive 
subject who is actively resisting and poses a threat to the safety of officers or others. Only Department issued or authorized impact weapons shall be used. Officers may 
resort to the use of other objects as impact weapons, such as a flashlight or police Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23

 radio, if exigent circumstances exist, and officers shall articulate the reason for doing 
so in the corresponding incident  report.  
2. WARNING - When using an impact weapon, an officer shall, if  feasible:  
a. Announce a warning to the subject of the intent to use the impact weapon if the subject does not comply with officer’s commands;  and 
b. Give the subject a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply, except that 
the officer need not do so where it would pose a risk to the public  or 
the officer 
or permit the subject to undermine the use of the impact weapon.
3. RESTRICTED USES -  Unless exigent circumstances exist, officers shall not 
intentionally strike vital areas, including the head, neck, face, throat, spine, groin or 
kidney. The use of an impact weapon to a vital area has a likelihood of causing 
serious bodily injury or death, and the intentional use of an impact weapon to these areas shall only be used in situations where lethal force is justified.  
4. PROHIBITED USES - Officers shall  not: 
a. Use the impact weapon to intimidate a subject or person, such as  slapping the 
palm of their hand with an impact weapon where neither the use of an impact weapon or impact weapon warning is  appropriate.  
b. Strike a handcuffed prisoner who poses no threat. This action is inappropriate and may result in disciplinary action and/or  criminal 
prosecution.  
5. MANDATORY MEDICAL ASSESSMENT -  Any officer who strikes a  subject 
with an impact weapon shall ensure the subject is medically  assessed.  
E. EXTENDED RANGE IMPACT WEAPON (ERIW) -  An Extended Range Impact 
Weapon (ERIW), such as a beanbag shotgun, is a weapon that fires a bean bag or other projectile designed to temporarily incapacitate a subject. An ERIW is generally not considered to be a lethal weapon when used at a range of 15 fe et or more.  
1. PURPOSE -  The ERIW may be used on a subject who is armed with a weapon that 
could cause serious injury or death. The ERIW may also be used in accordance 
with Department training to subdue an aggressive, unarmed subject who poses an imminent threat of serio us injury to another person or the  officer.  
2. USE -  The ERIW shall be properly loaded and locked in the shotgun rack of  the 
passenger compartment of the vehicle. Officers shall observe the following guidelines:  
a. An officer deploying an ERIW shall always have a lethal cover officer. When more than one officer is deploying an ERIW, tactical judgment and scene management in accordance with Department training will dictate  the 
appropriate number of ERIW and lethal cover  officers.  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 15 of 25  
 b. The ERIW officer’s point of aim shall be Zone 2 (waist and below).  The ERIW 
officer’s point of aim may be Zone 1 (waist and above)  if: 
i. Zone 2 is unavailable;  or 
ii. The ERIW officer is delivering the round from 60 feet;  or 
iii. Shots to Zone 2 have been ineffective or in the officer’s judgment  a shot to 
zone 2 would be  ineffective.
Officer shall articulate in writing the reason for intentionally aiming 
the ERIW at Zone 1.  
 
c. The use of an ERIW to a vital area has a likelihood of causing serious bodily injury or death, and the intentional use of an ERIW to these  areas shall only be 
used in situations where deadly force is  justified.  
d. The ERIW officer shall assess the effect of the ERIW after each shot.  If 
subsequent ERIW rounds are needed, the officer shall aim at a different target  
area.  
3. LIMITED USES -  The ERIW should not be used in the  following circumstances 
(unless the use of deadly force is  appropriate):  
a. The subject is at the extremes of age (elderly and children) or  physically frail.  
b. The subject is in an elevated position where a fall is likely to cause serious injury or  death.  
c. The subject is known or appears to be  pregnant.  
d. At ranges of less than 15 feet.  
4. WARNING - When using the ERIW, an officer shall, if  feasible:  
a. Announce to other officers the intent to use the ERIW by stating, “Red Light! 
Less Lethal! Less  Lethal!” 
b. All other officers at scene to acknowledge imminent deployment of ERIW by 
echoing, “Red Light! Less Lethal! Less  Lethal!”  
c. Announce a warning to the subject that the ERIW will be used if the subject 
does not comply with officer  commands;  
d. Give the subject a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply unless it would pose a risk to the community or the officer or permit the subject  to undermine the 
deployment of the  ERIW.  
5. MANDATORY MEDICAL ASSESSMENT -  Any subject who has been struck by an 
ERIW round shall be medically assessed by emergency medical personnel.  
6. BOOKING FORM - Persons who have been struck by an ERIW round  shall have that 
noted on the booking form.  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23

 F. VEHICLE INTERVENTIONS - An officer’s use of a police vehicle as a “deflection” 
technique, creation of a roadblock by any means, or deployment of tire deflation devices, or 
any other interventions resulting in the intentional contact with a vehicle for the purpose of making a dete ntion or arrest, are considered a use of force  upon each occupant of the 
vehicle and must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances.
1. The Department’s policies concerning an officer’s use of a police vehicle as a 
“deflection” technique, creation of a roadblock by any means, or any other 
interventions resulting in the intentional contact with a subject’s vehicle  during a 
vehicle pursuit  are set forth in DGO 5.05, Emergency Response and Pursuit  Driving . 
2. TIRE DEFLATION DEVICES (TDD) – TDD  use a variety of mechanical methods to 
defeat the integrity of vehicle tires to release the air pressure in a predictable, 
controlled manner.  
a.  PURPOSE – TDD are de -escalation tools and are intended as a defensive 
vehicle intervention tactic , deployed with the intent to afford time and distance 
by safely slowing a vehicle, thus reducing risk to the public , vehicle occupants, 
and officers. Tire deflation devices may be used proactively to prevent flight or 
assault, or reactively to intervene with a fleeing, reckless, or assaultive vehicle.  
b.  USE – TDD deployment should be considered in any of the following circumstances:  
i.  During a vehicle pursuit. TDD deployment  procedures  during a vehicle 
pursuit are governed by DGO 5.05.  
ii.  When a vehicle is being operated in a manner likely to cause death or serious bodily injury to the public, vehicle occupants, or officers.  
 
iii.  When there is probable cause to arrest or reasonable suspicion to detain an occupant of the vehicle and there is an articulable and reasonable belief  
that the operator of the vehicle has previously fled or is likely to flee if a 
vehicle stop is attempted.  
iv.  When there is probable cause to arrest or reasonable suspicion to detain an 
occupant of the vehicle and there is an articulable and reasonable belief 
that the occupant needs to be immediately apprehended because of the risk posed to public safety due to the seriousness of the crime.  
v.  To prevent the movement of a stationary vehicle when there is a reasonable belief that the vehicle will be operated or occupied by an individual in circumstances described in Section iii  or iv , above.  
vi.     During special events ( e.g., parades, large gatherings, races) to prevent 
any vehicle from causing serious bodily injury or death.  
c.  LIMITED USES – TDD s hall not be used in the following circumstances 
(unless the use of deadly force is appropriate):  Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 17 of 25  
 i.  Two or three wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles, mopeds, or motorized 
three wheelers.  
ii.  Any vehicle transporting a hazardous material as defined in section 2402.7 
of the California Vehicle Code.  
iii.  Any passenger or school bus currently transporting passengers.  
iv.  Any articulated vehicle such as a vehicle towing a trailer or a semi -
tractor/trailer combination.  
d.  TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT  
i.  Officers  may only deploy Department issued TDD . 
ii.  Officers  may only deploy a TDD after they have completed Department 
approved training on that specific type of TDD.  
e.  PROPERTY DAMAGE .  TDD contact with and/or damage to an unintended 
vehicle does not constitute a use of force and shall be documented according to Department pro cedures for damage to private property. 
 
G. FIREARMS AND OTHER DEADLY FORCE -  Deadly force is any use of force that 
creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury, including, but not 
limited to, the discharge of a firearm. It is the policy of this Department to use deadly force only as a last resort when reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or are not 
feasible to 
protect the safety of the public and police officers. The use of firearms and other deadly force is the 
most serious decision an officer may ever make. When safe and feasible under the totality of 
circumstances, officers shall consider other ob jectively reasonabl e force options before discharging 
a firearm or using other deadly force . Proper use of firearm for authorized training purposes, 
securing a weapon in accordance with Department protocols, or legal recreational activity is not 
within the purview of this General Order.  
1. HANDLING, DRAWING AND POINTING FIREARMS  
a. HANDLING FIREARMS -  An officer shall handle and manipulate a firearm in 
accordance with Department -approved firearms training. An officer shall not 
manually cock the hammer of the Department -issued handgun to defeat the first 
shot double -action  feature.  
b. AUTHORIZED USES - An officer may draw, exhibit, or point a firearm in the 
line of duty when an objectively reasonable officer, based on the totality of 
circumstances, would believe there is a specific and articulable threat of serious bodily injury or deat h, or that the situation may escalate to justify the use of 
deadly force. When an officer determines that the threat is over, the officer shall holster their firearm or shoulder the weapon in the port arms position pointed or slung in a manner consistent w ith Department approved firearms  training.  
c. DRAWING AND EXHIBITING A FIREARM -  For the purposes of this order, 
Drawing and Exhibiting occurs anytime an officer removes their handgun from its holster but does not point the firearm at a person. Officer(s) shall document Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 18 of 25  
 and articulate the justification and circumstances for Drawing and Exhibiting a 
firearm in their corresponding report. If an incident report is not otherwise 
required, the officer Drawing and Exhibiting the firearm shall memorialize and articulate the justification in their body -worn camera or CAD.  Supervisors shall 
complete a corresponding Drawing and Exhibiting Supervisory evaluation before the end of  watch.  
d. POINTING A FIREARM AT A PERSON -  For the purposes of this order, 
Pointing a Firearm occurs whenever an officer, with the muzzle of their drawn firearm, covers any portion of a person. No officer shall point a firearm at a person unless there is an objectively reasonable cause to believe the situation may escalate to justify deadly force. If an officer points a firearm at a person, the officer shall, if feasible, safe, and when appropriate, advise the subject the reason why the officer(s) pointed the firearm . Officers shall document and 
articulate their justification for pointing their firearm in the corresponding report. Supervisors shall complete a corresponding Use of Force Supervisory evaluation before the end of  watch . 
e. NOTIFICATION & EVALUATION – Whenever an officer draws, exhibits, or points a firearm, the officer shall notify their supervisor immediately or as soon as practical. The supervisor shall conduct a Use  of 
Force Supervisory Evaluation in circumstances where the officer pointed the firearm at a person; otherwise, the supervisor shall conduct a Drawing and Exhibiting Supervisory Evaluation.  
2. DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS OR OTHER USE OF DEADLY FORCE  
 
a. PERMISSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES -  Except as limited by  Sections  
5.01.07 G.2. d. and e., an officer may discharge a firearm or use other deadly force in any of the following circumstances. The circumstances below (2.a.i -iv) 
apply to a  discharge of a firearm or application of deadly force:  
i. In self -defense when the officer has reasonable cause to believe that 
they are in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury;  or 
ii. In defense of another person when the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. However, an officer may not discharge a firearm at, or use deadly 
force against, a person who presents a danger only to themself, and there is no reasonable cause to believe that the person poses an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or any other person;  or 
iii. To apprehend a person when both of the following circumstances exist:  
 The officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed or has attempted to commit a violent felony involving the use or threatened use of deadly force;  AND  
 The officer has reasonable cause to believe that a substantial  risk exists Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 19 of 25  
 that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to officers or 
others if the person’s apprehension is delayed;  or 
iv. To kill an animal posing an imminent  threat.  
Officers shall reassess the situation, when feasible and safe, to  determine 
whether the subject continues to pose an imminent  threat.  
b. VERBAL WARNING - If feasible, and if doing so would not increase the 
danger to the officer or others, an officer shall give a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the officer before discharging a firearm or using other deadly  force.  
c. REASONABLE CARE FOR THE PUBLIC -  To the extent feasible, an 
officer shall take reasonable care when discharging their firearm so as  not to 
jeopardize the safety of the public or  officers.  
d. PROHIBITED CIRCUMSTANCE -  Officers shall not discharge  their 
firearm:  
i. As a warning;  or 
ii. At a person who presents a danger only to themself.  
e. MOVING VEHICLES -  An officer shall not discharge a firearm at the 
operator or occupant of a moving vehicle unless the operator or  occupant  
poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the public or an officer by means other than the vehicle. Officers shall not discharge a firearm from their moving vehicle. 
3. RENDERING OR REQUESTING MEDICAL AID -  Following the use of deadly 
force, officers shall render or request medical aid if needed or requested by anyone as soon as reasonably possible. 
4. NOTIFICATION & EVALUATION -  Type IV force includes any use of  force 
involving the discharge of a firearm, the use of the Deflection vehicle pursuit intervention technique, or the application of any other deadly force. It also includes the use of low or intermediate force that results in death or serious bodily injury. In all circumstances, an officer using Type IV force shall notify their supervisor immediately or as soon as  practical.  
The supervisor shall immediately notify their Superior Officer and complete a corresponding Use of Force Supervisory Evaluation, with a referral for Pending Investigation by the end of watch.  
a. FIREARMS – Whenever an officer discharges a firearm, either on or  off- duty,

required under DGO 8.11, Investigation of Officer Involved Shootings and  
Discharges . Rev. 11/01/23 
                                                                                                                                 Eff. 12/ 18/23 
 
Page 20 of 25  
 b. OTHER DEADLY FORCE – Whenever an officer uses the Deflection pursuit 
intervention technique as defined in DGO 5.05, Emergency Response and Pursuit Driving, or other deadly force, the officer shall  notify their supervisor 
immediately or as soon as practical, as established under DGO 8.11, Investigation of Officer Involved Shootings and Discharges . 
c. FORCE RESULTING IN DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY– Force 
resulting in death, including during the application of low or intermediate force, shall be investigated in accordance with DGO 8.12, In- Custody Deaths . Force 
resulting in serious bodily injury shall be immediately reported by the superior officer to the commanding officer, who shall determine which unit shall be 
responsible for further investigation. 
5. DRAWING AND EXHIBITING A FIREARM – Drawing and Exhibiting a firearm 
is not a use of force; however, circumstances of Drawing and Exhibiting a Firearm 
are to be memorialized and reviewed in the following manner:  
a. The officer shall notify a supervisor of the Drawing and Exhibiting as soon as practical, before the end of  watch.  
b. The officer shall document and articulate the justification for the  Drawing and 
Exhibiting of the firearm in the corresponding incident  report.

to the reporting and investigative requirements of this General Order  and applicable 
disciplinary  policies.  
B. PROCEDURES  
1. OFFICER’S RESPONSIBILITY -  Any reportable use of force shall be documented 
in detail in an incident report, supplemental incident report, or statement form. 
Descriptions shall be in clear, precise and plain language and shall be as specific as  
possible. 
a. When the officer using force is preparing the incident report, the  officer shall 
include the following information:  
i. The subject’s action necessitating the use of force, including the threat 
presented by the  subject;  
ii. Efforts to de -escalate prior to the use of force; and if not, why not;
